# misogyny-detection
Built three models to detect misogyny against woman as an NLP project.

The project is built on a kaggle notebook with the input data being the following:
Download the GloVe model scraped from twitter through the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bertcarremans/glovetwitter27b100dtxt (file name: glove.twitter.27B.100d.txt) 
Upload the Sexism annotated data csv file onto the environment: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pes2ug20cs532/sexism (file name:sexism_data.csv) 
The notebook can be run in a regular python environment.
